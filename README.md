# Food Truck Project 
Homework for week 2
## Description
Overview: Users will input and rate a list of food trucks, then view the average rating and the highest-rated truck. 
To do this, we were to make use of a FoodTruck class and a separate FoodTruckApp. We were given an assortment of tasks including to store information about the trucks into the FoodTruck class. 
Using an array to establish the amount of Food Trucks the user could input, we were tasked with ensuring that data was displayed appropriate to the user's input. If they input less than 5 a prompt was provided to allow the user to quit and move to a main menu. 
The menu has several choices for the user that also take into account the amount of Food Trucks that were input. 
 
### Lessons Learned
- Still learning how to organize what I need to write in an efficient manner. I attempted to start writing without having laid out my plan which resulted in lost time and code that didn't work. 
- Syntax is everything, a missed } cost me an hour of time trouble shooting a while loop that became infinite. ^ having a better plan would have saved me here as well
- Learned more about encapsulation and the value that brings to data
- Became more familiar with which loops to use to fit desired outcome
- Once again coming back to organization I realized the importance of clear naming conventions and decided that I need to differentiate more distinctly when naming
